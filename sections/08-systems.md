# System Descriptions

## The Airplane

The RV-10 is a four-place, single-engine, low-wing aircraft with tricycle landing
gear. The airframe is primarily aluminum alloy construction with flush rivets,
except for some steel components including the engine mount, landing gear legs,
control surface bellcranks, and miscellaneous hardware. Wing tips, tail fairings,
cowling, and wheel fairings are fiberglass.

## Engine and Components

The aircraft is powered by a Lycoming IO-540 series engine, fuel injected and
normally aspirated, rated at 260 HP at 2700 RPM.

<!-- TODO: Add specific engine model and serial number -->

### Electronic Engine Management

The EFII System32 provides:

- **Full Electronic Ignition**: Dual redundant ignition with individual coil packs
  for each cylinder
- **Electronic Fuel Injection**: Precise fuel metering with automatic mixture
  optimization
- **Redundant ECUs**: Two independent Engine Control Units; panel switch allows
  manual ECU selection if needed

The System32 controller on the panel provides mixture control through the
electronic fuel injection system.

### Fuel Pumps

Two electric fuel pumps (primary and backup) pressurize the fuel line to the
engine. The system includes:

- **Automatic Switchover**: If fuel pressure drops below threshold, the System32
  automatically activates the backup pump
- **Manual Selection**: Panel switch (PMP 2) allows manual pump selection
- **Fuel Return**: Excess fuel returns to the originating tank

- **Yaw Trim**: None installed

### Co-Pilot Trim Enable

A panel switch enables or disables trim authority from the co-pilot stick grip.
This allows the pilot to disable co-pilot trim inputs when desired.

### Flaps

Electric flap motor with position indicator on EFIS. Controlled by:

- Panel-mounted flap switch
- Stick grip switch (both sticks)

Flap positions range from reflex (-3°) to full (40°).

## Fuel System

Fuel is stored in two wing tanks with a selector valve on the center tunnel.

| Left Tank Capacity | U.S. gallons |
| Right Tank Capacity | U.S. gallons |
| Total Capacity | U.S. gallons |

### Fuel System Components

- **Wing Tanks**: Integral tanks in wing leading edges
- **Fuel Selector**: Three-position valve (LEFT / RIGHT / OFF) on center tunnel
- **Fuel Pumps**: Primary and backup electric pumps (see Engine section)
- **Fuel Return**: Returns to selected tank
- **Fuel Strainer**: Drain before first flight of day

**Note**: The fuel system does not support inverted flight.

## Electrical System

### Power Sources

|-----------|---------------|
| Alternator | 60 amp, 14 volt |
| Battery 1 | EarthX ETX900 |
| Battery 2 | EarthX ETX900 |

### Bus Architecture

The electrical system uses a dual-bus architecture managed by the flyEFII
System32 Bus Manager:

- **Essential Bus**: Powers critical engine systems (ignition, fuel injection,
  fuel pumps)
- **Main Bus**: Powers avionics and other aircraft systems via VPX Sport

### Emergency Endurance Bus

If a battery fails or bus voltage drops critically, the System32 Bus Manager
automatically:

1. Disconnects non-essential loads from the main bus
2. Preserves all available power for the essential bus
3. Maintains engine ignition and fuel injection

The **EMERGENCY POWER** switch on the panel manually activates this mode.

### VPX Sport Power Distribution

The Vertical Power VPX Sport provides:

- Electronic circuit breaker protection
- Load monitoring and display on EFIS
- Automatic load shedding if needed
- No physical circuit breakers to reset
