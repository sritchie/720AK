### Low-Voltage Light Illuminates During Flight

    Illumination of the low-voltage light may occur during low RPM conditions with an electrical load on the system such as during a low RPM taxi. Under these conditions, the light will go out at higher RPM. The master switch need not be recycled since an over-voltage condition has not occurred to deactivate the alternator system.

- Heading ... **ADJUST AS NECESSARY**
    Using rudder
- Altitude and Airspeed ... **MAINTAIN**

### Emergency Descent Through Clouds

- Heading ... **EAST OR WEST**
    to minimize compass card swings due to changing bank angles
  In addition, keep hands off the control wheel and steer a straight course with rudder control by monitoring the turn coordinator. Occasionally check the compass heading and make minor corrections to hold an approximate course.
- Mixture ... **FULL RICH**
- Power ... **REDUCE**
    for 500 to 800 FPM descent
- Elevator and Rudder Trim ... **ADJUST**
    for stabilized descent at 80 KIAS

    by using coordinated aileron and rudder control
- Elevator ... **APPLY BACK PRESSURE**
    cautiously to slowly reduce the indicated airspeed to 80 KIAS
- Elevator Trim ... **ADJUST**
    to maintain an 86 KIAS glide
  Keep hands off the control wheel, using rudder control to hold straight heading. Use rudder trim to relieve unbalanced rudder force, if present.

- Throttle ... **IDLE**
- Ailerons ... **NEUTRAL**
- Rudder ... **FULL OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF ROTATION**
